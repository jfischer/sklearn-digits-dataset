This repo contains scikit-learn's digits dataset, as obtained from sklearn.datasets.load_digits().
The individual member fields of the "bunch" returned are stored in separate files and
versioned, so we can use them as an example in Data Workspaces.

See https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_digits_classification.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-classification-plot-digits-classification-py
for more details.
